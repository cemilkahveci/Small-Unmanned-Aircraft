# Small-Unmanned-Aircraft
6 DOF linearized small UAV Model

First of all, I produced the contents I presented here inspired by the book Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice(https://github.com/randybeard/uavbook).
This book, which has contributed greatly to my work, is well organized so that it can be easily grasped by any engineering student.

This adventure, which begins with the extraction of the aerodynamic equations of a vehicle of approximately 10 kilogram, continues with the use of the obtained nonlinear equations to derive a transfer function. On the other hand, the linearized model within the framework of a state space model becomes available for trim adjustment. Trim calculation methods on Matlab are also presented in this content.
